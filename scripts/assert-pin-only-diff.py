"""Refuse a unified diff that changes anything but a dependency pin.

Read a diff on stdin (`gh pr diff <n> | scripts/assert-pin-only-diff.py`) and
exit non-zero unless every changed file is one of the pin surfaces below and
every changed line differs from its counterpart in nothing but a version.

Ported from rsync-crypt's script of the same name (which itself carried the
reasoning forward from docker-torrent-box-with-vpn), the check that stands
between "renovate[bot] opened a pull request" and an unattended merge here. It
exists for the same reason: approving a bot's pull request on the strength of
its author means the bot identity holds write access to main, and a diff that
is not actually pin-only is exactly the shape a compromised or misconfigured
bot would take. A path allowlist alone would not be much of a fence, since
`.github/workflows/` and the checklist files under `checklists/` are
executable and behavioral surfaces on their own; the line comparison below is
what makes it one.

The comparison normalizes both sides and requires them to match line for line
per file, duplicates counted. A line whose structure changed has no
counterpart and the diff is refused, which covers
`uses: actions/checkout@<sha> # v7` becoming `uses: evil/checkout@<sha> # v7`
as much as it covers an added `curl | sh`. Anything this refuses is not
broken, it just waits for a person: the approval is skipped and the pull
request sits there, which is the direction to fail in.

What it deliberately does not catch: a bump to a version that exists but is
malicious. `actionlint`'s `rev: v1.7.12` becoming `rev: v1.7.13` is exactly
the change this file exists to permit, and no amount of diff reading can tell
a good release from a backdoored one.

Four pin surfaces, and nothing else, chosen to match where a version pin
actually lives in this repository:

- `.tool-versions`: asdf tool versions (`pre-commit 4.5.1`), owned by
  Renovate's asdf manager.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: this repo's own dogfood config, at the root.
  Every hook here is `repo: local` today (see that file's own header
  comment for why), so it has no `rev:` pins yet, but Renovate's
  pre-commit manager already watches it and this surface is ready the day
  that changes.
- `checklists/`: every `checklists/checklist-*.yaml` file's own `rev:`
  pins on the upstream hooks it wraps (`actionlint`, `pre-commit-hooks`,
  and so on), watched by the same Renovate `pre-commit` manager, an
  explicit `managerFilePatterns` entry in .github/renovate.json5 reaching
  this directory since none of these files are literally named
  .pre-commit-config.yaml, the one name the manager's own default pattern
  matches.
- `.github/workflows/`: `uses: ...@<sha> # vX` action pins, owned by
  Renovate's github-actions manager.

Deliberately not a pin surface here: the three version strings inside
checklists/*.yaml that a Renovate *custom.regex* manager watches instead of
the built-in `pre-commit` manager (the dotenv-linter Docker tag in
checklist-dev-dotenv.yaml, zizmor's PyPI pin in checklist-github-actions.yaml,
markdown-link-check's npm pin in checklist-markdown.yaml; see
docs/versioning.md). Each lives inside an `entry:` or
`additional_dependencies:` line with no shared shape to anchor a safe regex
on the way `rev:` or a `uses:` SHA does, so a bump to any of them fails this
assertion and waits for a person, same as a major bump does. That is the
conservative direction to be wrong in: those pull requests get no automatic
approval rather than a false one.

# would match most of a workflow file. It is matched whole-line instead, and
# only for that file, which is why normalize() takes the path. The value
# after the space has to be a real release, not merely non-blank: `pre-commit
# main` would otherwise normalize identically to `pre-commit 4.5.1`.

# reads as a difference.
#
# GitHub Actions pins are handled separately below rather than through this
# same released-version grammar: this repository, like the one it was ported
# from, pins every action to a full commit SHA rather than a tag (see any
# `uses:` line in .github/workflows/), so the immutable shape to require
# there is a SHA, not a release number.

# A GitHub Actions pin, always a full 40 character commit SHA in this
# repository (Renovate's github-actions manager updates it that way),
# optionally followed by the trailing `# vX.Y.Z` comment Renovate writes and
# rewrites alongside it. The negative lookahead stops a 40 character prefix
# of a longer hex run from matching and silently swallowing the character
# that would have made the shapes differ.
#
# The trailing comment has to be normalized too, not left as ordinary text:
# this repository pins with a full semver comment (`# v7.0.1`), not a
# major-version-only one (`# v7`), so Renovate rewrites that comment on
# every bump, patch releases included. Leaving it untouched would refuse
# every ordinary action bump as "not pin-only", which defeats the entire
# point of this script. The comment is optional in the regex so a `uses:`
# line with no trailing comment, or one that is not version-shaped (and
# therefore not matched, left as literal text for both sides to compare
# against), is still handled correctly: only a comment that already looks
# like a release is treated as part of the pin.
#
# Case-insensitive (`[0-9a-fA-F]`, not `[0-9a-f]`): GitHub resolves a
# `uses:` SHA the same way regardless of case, so an uppercase or
# mixed-case SHA is just as real a pin as a lowercase one, and matching
# only lowercase left a gap a CodeRabbit review of BARE_ACTION_VERSION
# below found: an uppercase SHA on a first-time pin's new side fell
# through ACTION_SHA entirely and was accepted by BARE_ACTION_VERSION's
# generic RELEASE grammar instead, which does not check that a
# first-time pin's target is SHA-shaped at all.
#
# Anchored to a genuine `uses:` field at the start of the line, the same
# anchor BARE_ACTION_VERSION uses, rather than a bare `@<sha>` matched
# anywhere: a follow-up CodeRabbit finding pointed out the original,
# unanchored ACTION_SHA matched a 40 character hex run on ANY changed
# workflow line, `run:` step content included, so a `run:` command could
# change while its normalized form stayed equal, as long as the line
# still ended in something SHA-shaped. `prefix` now captures the full
# `uses: owner/repo@` text, not only `@`, and `_normalize_action_sha`
# reuses that whole prefix unchanged, so the dependency name stays
# literal to the left exactly as it already did.

# A first-time pinDigests bump changes `uses: actions/checkout@v7` to
# `uses: actions/checkout@<sha> # v7` in one step, with no prior SHA to
# compare against, and the trailing release comment appearing for the
# first time alongside it. ACTION_SHA above normalizes the pinned side to
# `@<version> # <version>` whenever a comment trails the SHA, which every
# first-time pin carries in practice (proven on docker-torrent-box-with-vpn's
# own PR #178, where Renovate never added a bare SHA with no comment on
# this update type). This pattern gives the unpinned side the identical
# placeholder, so the two sides of a first-time pin compare equal the same
# way an ordinary SHA-to-SHA bump does. A first-time pin whose comment is
# missing still reads as structural and gets refused, the correct,
# fail-closed outcome for a shape that never happens on a clean bump.
#
# Scoped to a `uses:` field and an owner/repo coordinate immediately before
# the `@`, not bare `@RELEASE` anywhere on the line, per a CodeRabbit
# finding on docker-torrent-box-with-vpn's own version of this pattern:
# an unscoped version would let a `run:` step's own `tool@v7` normalize
# the same way, so that line could grow an unrelated-looking SHA and
# comment and still read as pin-only.
#
# `uses:` alone is not narrow enough, as a second CodeRabbit finding on
# this exact pattern went on to show: `\buses:` is a word-boundary check,
# not a position check, so it matches the substring "uses:" anywhere a
# line contains it, including inside a `run:` step's own text
# (`run: uses: actions/checkout@v7` normalized the same way a real `uses:`
# line did). Anchored to the start of the line instead, with only an
# optional YAML list marker (`- `) and indentation in front of `uses:`,
# which is the only place a real `uses:` field can sit.
#
# Applying ACTION_SHA first, ahead of this one, is what keeps the two from
# double matching an already-pinned line with no comment. RELEASE's
# character class is wide enough to also accept a 40 character hex run, but
# ACTION_SHA has already replaced that run with `<version>` by the time this
# pattern runs, and `<version>` does not start with a digit or a bare `v`.
#
# The version is its own capture group, `bare_version`, rather than folded
# unnamed into the match, because a third CodeRabbit finding on this exact
# pattern showed RELEASE alone is still too permissive:
# `_normalize_bare_action_version` below refuses a 40 character match
# outright, real hex or not, because 40 characters is the shape ACTION_SHA
# exists to own exclusively. Without that check, a non-hex 40 character
# token, `0` followed by 39 `z`s for instance, never matches ACTION_SHA (not
# hex, even case-insensitively) and was accepted here instead, since
# nothing about this pattern's own grammar checked that the "version"
# replacing a first-time pin's bare tag was ever a real SHA at all, only
# that it was RELEASE-shaped. A real first-time pin's target is always
# exactly a 40 character SHA, ACTION_SHA's exclusive domain, so anything
# that length reaching this pattern instead is already suspect, and
# refusing it outright costs nothing: a length that long never occurs in a
# genuine bare release tag either.
