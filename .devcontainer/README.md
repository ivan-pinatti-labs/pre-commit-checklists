# Development container

Everything this repository needs to develop and verify it locally, inside a
container: every hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (including the ones that
start containers of their own, such as `hadolint-docker`, `actionlint-docker`
and dotenv-linter), the self-test suite (`tests/run_tests.sh`), `gh`, and
`git` pushes over SSH. It is built on the organization's base image from
[ivan-pinatti-labs/devcontainer-images](https://github.com/ivan-pinatti-labs/devcontainer-images),
whose `docs/IMAGES.md` explains the image itself.

It runs with rootless Podman, and SELinux stays enforcing the whole time.

## Before the first start

Two things live on the host, outside any container, and are set up once.

### A GitHub token for `gh`

A fine-grained personal access token for the `ivan-pinatti-labs` organization
with read and write access to pull requests and issues, and read access to
actions, commit statuses and contents. Nothing else: no administration,
secrets or organization permissions. Store it as a Podman secret:

```shell
podman secret create gh-devcontainer /path/to/a/file/holding/the/token
```

Delete that file afterwards. The container receives the token as `GH_TOKEN`;
it never appears in `podman inspect`.

### An SSH agent for `git push`

A dedicated SSH key, not your usual one, held by an ssh-agent that runs in its
own container. The development container can ask that agent to sign a GitHub
login but never sees the key, and the key is restricted to GitHub, so nothing
running in the development container can use it anywhere else.

Create the key with a passphrase and add its public half to your GitHub
account as an authentication key:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C devcontainer -f ~/.ssh/devcontainer/id_ed25519
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/devcontainer
```

Start the agent container. It has no network, no capabilities and a read
only filesystem, and it runs in the same SELinux domain and category as the
development container, which is what allows the two to talk:

```shell
mkdir -p "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/devcontainer-ssh"
chmod 700 "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/devcontainer-ssh"
curl -fsS https://api.github.com/meta \
  | jq -r '.ssh_keys[] | "github.com " + .' \
  > "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/devcontainer-ssh/known_hosts"
podman run -d --name devcontainer-ssh-agent \
  --network=none --cap-drop=all --read-only \
  --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  --userns=keep-id \
  --security-opt label=type:container_engine_t \
  --security-opt label=level:s0:c555,c666 \
  -v "${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/devcontainer-ssh:/sock:Z" \
  -v "${HOME}/.ssh/devcontainer:/key:ro,Z" \
  ghcr.io/ivan-pinatti-labs/devcontainer-base@sha256:422d159cc15e46e4ae806bcf718d63ea5bd080fa701ab7a980e45b55d955b602 \
  ssh-agent -D -a /sock/agent.sock
```

Then unlock the key once per login, typing the passphrase:

```shell
podman exec -it -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/sock/agent.sock devcontainer-ssh-agent \
  ssh-add -H /sock/known_hosts -h github.com /key/id_ed25519
```

GitHub's host keys come from GitHub's own API rather than from a first
connection, so the development container verifies the host strictly.

## Starting it

Open the repository's main clone, not a worktree, and choose **Reopen in
Container**. Worktrees created inside the container work normally. A worktree
opened directly does not, because its git metadata lives in the main clone,
outside the folder that gets mounted.

## Why each run argument

| Argument | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `--userns=keep-id` | Files in the mounted clone keep your own user id on the host. |
| `label=type:container_engine_t` | The confined SELinux domain that allows a container engine to run inside, so the hooks that start containers work without turning SELinux labeling off. |
| `label=level:s0:c555,c666` | The same SELinux category as the ssh-agent container; a different category cannot connect to its socket. |
| `--device /dev/fuse` | The nested container storage driver needs it. |
| `--secret gh-devcontainer,...` | The GitHub token, as `GH_TOKEN`. |
| The workspace mount at the clone's own path | Paths inside the container match the host, so git worktree metadata and the bind mounts hooks make resolve the same way in both. |
| The `devcontainer-ssh` mount | The ssh-agent socket and GitHub's host keys. |

## What it runs

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
tests/run_tests.sh
```

Tool versions come only from this repository's `.tool-versions`. A tool it
does not pin is missing in the container rather than borrowed from somewhere
else, which is how a missing pin shows up.
